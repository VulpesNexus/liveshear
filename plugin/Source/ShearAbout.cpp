/* The About dialog.
 *
 * The same window Subgroup shows, deliberately: one About box for every
 * Illustrator plugin here, so a reader who has seen one has seen them all.
 * The layout, the control set, the two-band background and the code that
 * paints it are copied rather than reinvented, and the prose below is the only
 * part that differs.
 *
 * Why a dialog rather than the SDK's helper. SDKAboutPluginsHelper::PopAboutBox
 * takes a char* and builds an ai::UnicodeString from it with the *platform*
 * encoding, so an em dash or a copyright sign becomes mojibake wherever the
 * code page is not Latin-1 -- this machine's is 932. It also ends in a plain OS
 * alert: one run of unstyled text, no links, no way to mark a command name.
 *
 * A dialog of static controls would get bold, because a static can be given a
 * bold font, but it cannot get italics *within a sentence*: a static has
 * exactly one font. Hence a rich edit control for the prose, which is the one
 * common control that changes font mid-sentence, and SysLink controls for the
 * links, which handle their own hit-testing and keyboard focus.
 *
 * There are no Illustrator types below. That is what lets a harness build this
 * same file and show it, which is the only way to actually look at a modal
 * dialog that otherwise appears only inside a host application. The colors
 * arrive as a plain struct for the same reason.
