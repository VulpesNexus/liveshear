/* Where a dialog opens.
 *
 * Both windows this plugin shows -- the Shear dialog and the About box -- open
 * in the middle of Illustrator's window, which is where the host puts its own.
 * They work it out here rather than each keeping a copy, so they cannot come
 * to disagree about it. The About box did disagree: it centered on its owner
 * and stopped there, which is the same window placed off the edge of the
 * desktop that the Shear dialog was fixed for in 0.1.0-rc.6.
 *
 * CW_USEDEFAULT cannot do this. It is documented to apply to overlapped
 * windows only, and for a popup -- which both of these windows are -- the x
 * and y are simply taken as zero. That is not a fallback position, it is the
 * top-left corner of the primary monitor, and it is where the Shear dialog
 * opened every time until 0.1.0-rc.6.
 *
 * Centering on the owner is the whole of the idea; the rest is making sure the
 * result is somewhere a person can reach. The window is pushed back inside the
 * work area of whatever monitor it lands on, so an Illustrator sitting against
 * a screen edge -- or spanning two -- cannot put the dialog half off the
 * desktop or under the taskbar.
 *
 * There are no Illustrator types here, for the same reason there are none in
 * ShearAbout.cpp: the About harness builds that file on its own, and this
 * header goes with it.
