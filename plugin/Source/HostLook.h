//  HostLook.h -- Illustrator's own look for this plugin's plain Win32 windows:
//  its interface typeface, its icons, and the shape of its buttons.
//
//  Nothing of Adobe's is copied into the plugin. The typeface and the icons
//  are read at run time from modules Illustrator always loads, and the
//  buttons are drawn to measurements taken from Adobe's own dialogs. Like the
//  dialogs that use it, this file takes no Illustrator types, so a standalone
//  harness builds it too; outside Illustrator it reads the installed copy,
//  given with UseSupportFiles.
