/** The colors to draw the About dialog in.

    Passed in rather than read here, which is the whole point: Illustrator
    knows what it is painting its own dialogs with, and this file must not know
    what Illustrator is. A plain struct of COLORREFs crosses that line without
    dragging the SDK across it, so the dialog can be built into a small harness
    and looked at directly -- in either theme -- instead of being inspected
    only through the host, which for a modal dialog means not at all.

    Defaults are the system colors, which is what a plugin looks like before it
    can be told otherwise, and what it falls back to on a host that declines to
    say. */
